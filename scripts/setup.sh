#
# The harness owns activation now, so the framework steps here are `mf` calls
# rather than a second implementation of them: `mf hooks install` wires the
# gates and refuses a hooks path it does not own, and `mf doctor` reports what
# resolves and what is missing. What remains this repository's own is the
# triage labels, which live in its tracker and nowhere else.
