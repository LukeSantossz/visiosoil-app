# Deliberately hypothetical names mentioned in prose (not links) are listed
# here explicitly; each entry needs a justification:
# - CONTRIBUTING.md: named by github.md's README template as an optional file
#   adopting projects may add; this repo does not have one.
# - CLAUDE.full.md: named by token_economy.md as an example name for an
#   uncompressed copy; intentionally absent.
# - SPEC.md: the artifact's generic name in prose; concrete specs live under
#   docs/specs/, and the root working copy no longer exists.
# This exemption applies to references found in any scanned standards file,
# including INDEX.md itself.
