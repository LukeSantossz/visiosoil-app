# SPEC: chore(standards): adopt the v0.8.0 harness so the gates here stop passing without checking

## Problem

This repository is pinned to `v0.7.2`, in which six of the harness's own gates
report `ok` while verifying nothing — among them an exempt-path glob that means
different things on Windows than in CI, and an R1 attestation any machine-wide
git setting satisfies.

## Scope

- Includes: the `.standards` pin at `v0.8.0`; `.framework.lock`.
- Does NOT include: any change to this repository's `.framework.toml`, which the
  upgrade preflight below shows needs none; regenerating `CLAUDE.md` or
  `AGENTS.md`, since `v0.8.0` changes no document under `docs/agents/` or
  `docs/standards/` and the agents gate confirms it; any change to the overlay
  at `docs/agents/project.md`, whose contents this release does not touch.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `the_pin_and_the_lock_name_the_same_version`
- `mf check` passes here against the v0.8.0 binary.
- `mf check agents` reports both generated files still match their source and
  their overlay, so no regeneration is owed.
- `none_of_the_five_upgrade_cases_applies_to_this_repository`

## Reproducibility

```sh
git submodule status .standards                 # v0.8.0
grep framework_version .framework.lock          # v0.8.0
mf version                                      # mf v0.8.0
mf check
```

The five upgrade cases `.standards/docs/specs/0050-release-v0-8-0.md` lists,
checked here before the pin moved:

```sh
grep exempt_paths .framework.toml               # ["README.md", "LICENSE", ".gitignore"] — no wildcard
grep -E '^\s*file\s*=\s*""' .framework.toml     # nothing
grep -rn MF_PATHS_ .github                      # nothing
git config --global --get mf.attestation.r1     # unset; the attestation here is local
```

Versions: `mf` v0.8.0.

## Risks and Assumptions

- Assumption: nothing here relies on a `paths.*` value from outside the project
  file, on an empty `agents.<name>.file`, or on a wildcard exempt path. Each was
  read out of the tree above rather than assumed.
- Assumption: this repository is the only one using `paths.agents_overlay`, so
  it is the only place a change to overlay handling would surface. `v0.8.0`
  makes none.
